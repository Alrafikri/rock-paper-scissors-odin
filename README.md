This is a repository for my learning in The Odin Project.

My current learning is still in Web Dev 101, the very first course :D

I hope I can understand better about Web Dev after completing this course.

From The Odin Project's [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/rock-paper-scissors)
